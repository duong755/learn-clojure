# Problem 27, Palindrome Detector

**Difficulty:** easy

Write a function which returns true if the given sequence is a palindrome. Hint: "racecar" does not equal '(\r \a \c \e \c \a \r)

```clj
(false? (__ '(1 2 3 4 5)))
```

```clj
(true? (__ "racecar"))
```

```clj
(true? (__ [:foo :bar :foo]))
```

```clj
(true? (__ '(1 1 3 3 1 1)))
```

```clj
(false? (__ '(:a :b :c)))
```
