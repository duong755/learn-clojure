# Problem 80, Perfect Numbers

**Difficulty:** medium

A number is "perfect" if the sum of its divisors equal the number itself. 6 is a perfect number because 1+2+3=6. Write a function which returns true for perfect numbers and false otherwise.

```clj
(= (__ 6) true)
```

```clj
(= (__ 7) false)
```

```clj
(= (__ 496) true)
```

```clj
(= (__ 500) false)
```

```clj
(= (__ 8128) true)
```
