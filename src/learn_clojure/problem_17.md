# Problem 17, map

**Difficulty:** elementary

The map function takes two arguments: a function (f) and a sequence (s). Map returns a new sequence consisting of the result of applying f to each item of s. Do not confuse the map function with the map data structure.

```clj
(= __ (map #(+ % 5) '(1 2 3)))
```
