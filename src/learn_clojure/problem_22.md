# Problem 22, Count a Sequence

**Difficulty:** easy

Write a function which returns the total number of elements in a sequence.

```clj
(= (__ '(1 2 3 3 1)) 5)
```

```clj
(= (__ "Hello World") 11)
```

```clj
(= (__ [[1 2] [3 4] [5 6]]) 3)
```

```clj
(= (__ '(13)) 1)
```

```clj
(= (__ '(:a :b :c)) 3)
```
