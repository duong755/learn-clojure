# Problem 143, dot product

**Difficulty:** easy

Create a function that computes the dot product of two sequences. You may assume that the vectors will have the same length.

```clj
(= 0 (__ [0 1 0] [1 0 0]))
```

```clj
(= 3 (__ [1 1 1] [1 1 1]))
```

```clj
(= 32 (__ [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
```

```clj
(= 256 (__ [2 5 6] [100 10 1]))
```
